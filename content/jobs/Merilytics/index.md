- Built a Logistic Regression classifier to understand the customer retention based on historical customer experience and demographic variables. This helped the client in understanding and quantifying the factors affecting retention and in designing marketing campaigns for a more focused customer base. The campaigns resulted in increased monthly customer retention by 50%.
- Designed the data pipeline and created dashboards to track ~15 company level KPIs on a real-time basis using Python, SQL, and Power BI, resulting in increased visibility to the C-suite. This involved collecting, merging, and transforming data from multiple sources (NetSuite, Data warehouse, SharePoint).
- Helped a private equity client with market research and in gathering and analyzing the financials of companies in their due diligence stages.
